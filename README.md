This is a rough and quick visualization of some ideas inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/cLOzeefEiVo?si=rkcOW2csF3_95NGh) from Demotro's Combo Class.

Change the value of n in the first code cell to create different sizes of matrix. 512 gives enough detail near the origin.
More than 512 will start to take a lot of time. I might optimize the functions in a later iteration.
It is easiest to restart the kernel and go from a fresh start if you change n.

There are comments throughout to guide you in places that can be changed for interesting effects.
Some code is commented out and may need to be toggled on as part of those changes.
Similarly you might have to read the errors after a change and comment to disable some things.
